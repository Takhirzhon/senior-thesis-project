# 🛰️ AI-Driven Geospatial System for Landslide and Mudflow Prediction in Southern Kyrgyzstan

This project implements an AI-powered geospatial system designed to **predict and monitor landslides and mudflows** in the southern region of Kyrgyzstan. It combines **machine learning**, **remote sensing data**, and **GIS tools** to support disaster risk management and improve early warning capabilities.

## 🌍 Key Features
- Integration of **satellite imagery**, **topographic**, and **climatic data**
- Machine learning models for **risk zone identification and hazard prediction**
- Geospatial visualization and mapping using **open-source GIS libraries**
- Modular architecture for **data ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, and analysis**

## 🎯 Objective
To provide a scalable, data-driven decision support system that helps stakeholders in **monitoring**, **forecasting**, and **managing landslide and mudflow risks** in vulnerable areas.
